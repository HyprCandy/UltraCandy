# HyprCandy/UltraCandy
âž¡[UltraCandy](https://ko-fi.com/s/f56114285c)/[HyprCandy](https://mirukai.gumroad.com/l/cxsyj)â¬… is a system-wide, cohesively themed Hyprland configuration for Arch and Arch-based distributions with extra quality of life features. I recommend hyprpanel on HyprCandy and waybar for UltraCandy users.

## Features & How to reach me or support : 

â€¢ Automatic idle-inhbitor activated when waybar/hyprpanel is toggled off whenever you want extra screen space since you won't be able to activate it through waybar's/hyprpanel's idle-inhibitor button. This is great for lighter resource usage as well while still being able to keep your device awake.

â€¢ System-wide color generation for GTK3/4 and QT6 applications plus other Hyprland elements along with other other quality of life settings.

â€¢ The background is also cohesively auto-generated and applied for sddm, rofi, wlogout and hyprlock (GDM backgrounds have to be set manually through the 'GDM Settings' app but it's available as an option).

If you like my work, run the free HyprCandy [install script](https://mirukai.gumroad.com/l/cxsyj) or grab the UltraCandy [install script](https://ko-fi.com/s/f56114285c). You can also grab bits and bops from the [main repo](https://github.com/HyprCandy/Hyprcandy.git) or you can [support my work](https://ko-fi.com/ianmking) or just spread the word of this cohesive Hyprland setup ðŸ™‚.

NOTE: I wrote systemd services for these features so you'd have to run the script for them to work but other configs should work fine without my setup if you don't want it ... I think

Since I'm an aeronautics graduate and not a programmer it took me ages to learn how to set up everything during my free time before creating this repo. It was stressful abut worthwhile in the end. Anyway checkout the little showcase below:
